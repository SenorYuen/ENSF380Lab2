Adam Yuen, Shahed Issa ENSF380

How to Run:
- The user can run this code within the IDE of their choice.
- There is not need for command line arguments; all of it is done through the command line interface.
How to use:
- The user will be greeted by the main menu. By typing in the number indicated, they can select different options.
- To fully test the functionality, it is best to add a client, then a pet, and then remove the pet to ensure all functions work.
  - The default state of the program has all of the data fields empty, so adding a pet and client will solve this.
